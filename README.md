# AI-Driven Content Generation for Financial Services

## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize the way financial services websites engage with their clients by providing personalized, AI-generated content. We utilize a pre-trained AI model, fine-tuned to cater to a diverse range of financial products and services, with the ability to tailor content to various audience segments.

## Features

- **Personalized Content**: Generate content tailored for checking accounts, savings accounts, mortgages, and more.
- **Diverse Audience Engagement**: Target content to international students, foreign workers, and permanent residents.
- **Adaptive Tone**: Craft the content tone to be precise, balanced, or creative based on client strategies.
- **React Front-End**: A sleek, user-friendly interface for content customization and interaction.
- **Python API**: A robust backend API facilitating communication between the front end and the AI model.
- **NoSQL Database**: Store and manage predefined prompts and user preferences.
