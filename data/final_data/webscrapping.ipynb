To take advantage of this Promotional Offer, you must complete the Balance Transfer request within 30 days of Account approval. You must also activate your Card within 45 days of Account approval for the requested Balance Transfer to be processed, or the Balance Transfer will be automatically cancelled. Balance Transfers are treated as Cash Advances on your Card and do not have an interest-free grace period. Balance Transfers may not exceed the available credit on the Account.

This Balance Transfer Fee is waived by Tangerine if you are a resident of the province of Quebec at the time you accept this offer. Interest does not accrue on the Balance Transfer Fee, however it is included in the Minimum Payment amount on your monthly statement. You must continue to make all of your monthly Minimum Payments by the Payment Due Dates shown on your monthly statements. If you still have an amount owing from your Balance Transfer when the Promotional Rate Period ends, the Cash Advance interest rate of 19.95% will apply to that amount. You must continue to make the Minimum Payments on your Account, regardless of whether the Balance Transfer has been processed to your Account. Balance Transfers may not be used to transfer money to or from another Tangerine Account.

To learn about which coverage(s) are included with a specific card, and important information regarding coverage eligibility requirements, benefits, limitations and exclusions, go toAgreements and Insuranceand review the insurance certificate(s) in your card package. Some insurance coverage(s) require purchase(s), auto rentals, common carrier fares and other trip costs to be charged to the card to activate coverage. Other conditions may also apply. Auto Rental Collision and Loss Damage Insurance (CLDI) is available for automobile rentals of up to 48 days. The full cost of the rental must be charged to the card and the rental agency's Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) must be declined. CLDI provides coverage up to the actual cash value (ACV) of the rental vehicle as defined in your insurance certificate. Note that some rental agencies may assess their damages at an amount greater than the ACV of the rental vehicle and you may be liable to them for the difference. Before declining the rental agency's CDW or LDW, you should read carefully and compare the terms of the rental agreement, the CLDI insurance certificate in your card package and any other insurance you own to decide which coverage best meets your protection needs. Out-of-Province Emergency Travel Medical Insurance (TMI) covers the primary cardholder, their spouse and dependent children for the first 15 days of a trip if the covered person is age 64 or under. Dependent children must be age 20 or under or a full-time student age 24 or under, unless they have a permanent physical or mental deficiency.

      "First things first: welcome to Canada! Here’s hoping your time here will work out well.\n",
      "Secondly: how’s the financial planning going? Because new immigrants to Canada, just like everyone else, benefit from building up credit.\n",
      "Credit cards for newcomers to Canada are plentiful, and there are options for everyone, whether or not you have money in reserve. So here are a few of the best options out there – not all of them – and hopefully one of them might sound right for you.\n",
      "You’ll also learn howWiseand itscardcan help you if you’re moving to or just arrived in Canada.\n",
      "Order your Wise card today and start saving\n",
      "Before the rundown, here are a few things to bear in mind.\n",
      "First of all, remember that you’ll need to get a bank account sorted as well. A lot of Canadian banks offer a complete package for newcomers, so you can get a current account and not just a credit card. Here are some of those:\n",
      "But of course credit cards are their own thing, and you may want to go with a different credit card provider, or simply prioritize getting a decent credit card deal so that you can best capitalize on rewards, cash back, and so on.\n",
      "Additionally, if you’re coming to Canada to study, you might want to considerinternational student credit cardsspecifically, to make the most of some specially tailored offers.\n",
      "If you’ve just moved to Canada, you should know about the Wise card - it’s not a credit card, but it will allow you to save when converting your money. In fact,using Wise is 4x cheaper than banks for spending abroad.\n",
      "You canset up your account and order a cardin just a few minutes.\n",
      "You won’t have high or hidden foreign transaction fees - your money gets converted with the real mid-market rate, no matter if you spend in-person or online in over 200 countries.\n",
      "The only cost you’ll have is a very low and transparent conversion fee, in case you need to convert between currencies. Unlike other accounts, there are no monthly or annual charges, nor any minimum balance requirements.\n",
      "The Wise card is part of the Wise account, which means that you can add, hold, and convert over 40 currencies instantly. You can get your own bank details for 10 different currencies (including CAD, USD, GBP, EUR, and more) to receive money from those places.\n",
      "Order your Wise debit card today\n",
      "If you’re new to Canada, Scotiabank offers a lot of credit cards that you might want to consider, but a particularly good option is the range of Scotia Momentum Visa credit cards.\n",
      "There are several of them you can consider: there’s the Momentum No-Fee Visa¹, there’s the standard one which costs $39 a year², and there’s Visa Infinite, which is $120 a year (first year fee waived)³. They all offer cash back: 1% or 0.5% on everything eligible for the No-Fee card, rising to 4% off groceries and recurring payments with the Infinite card.\n",
      "The No-Fee card might be particularly good for newcomers as a way to build up credit; it has a minimum credit limit of just $500. The Infinite card, meanwhile, is a quality credit card designed for those with a high annual income.\n",
      "Another credit card from Scotiabank that newcomers might like is the Scene Visa Card⁴. This is aimed at entertainment lovers, with as many as 5 points per dollar spent at Cineplex. There’s no annual fee to pay, so lovers of the silver screen, especially those on a budget, might be tempted.\n",
      "Scotiabank have quite a few other possibilities too. There’s the Value Visa, which costs $29 a year and has a low interest rate of 12.99%⁵. There’s the Passport, with extra points for frequent travelers⁶. And there’s an American Express credit card on offer as well, also designed with travelers in mind⁷.\n",
      "Newcomers to Canada looking for a straightforward no-fee credit card that helps them out with daily purchases may want to consider the BMO CashBack Mastercard. It offers at least 0.5% cash back on everything, and 3% on groceries, which for a no-annual-fee card is considerable⁸.\n",
      "You’ll need to check your eligibility carefully. While it’s certainly possible to get this card as a new immigrant via BMO’s NewStart program, the website notes that for the credit card you need to be a permanent resident, as well as meeting minimum income requirements⁸. A secured credit card from BMO might be an option if you don’t qualify for the unsecured CashBack credit card⁹.\n",
      "Another good option if you’re already a permanent resident of Canada but not necessarily on a high salary is the Tangerine Money-Back Mastercard. With no annual fee and an offer of 2% or 0.5% cashback on all purchases¹⁰, the Money-Back Credit Card is open to those with a gross annual income of at least $12,000¹¹.\n",
      "Probably the most tempting thing about this card is that its 2% cash back offer includes a wide range of categories including groceries, gas, entertainment, recurring bills, and restaurants¹⁰. Also, if you’re earning at least $60,000 – or your household brings in $100,000 overall – the Tangerine World Mastercard offers a few additional features, still with no annual fee¹¹.\n",
      "RBC’s Newcomer Advantage program offers people new to Canada a package that could include a credit card with a limit of up to $15,000 – and personal banking clients with RBC don’t need to go through a credit history check. So if you’re looking for a whole deal rather than just a card, this could be worth a look.\n",
      "There’s no annual fee for the Rewards+ Visa card, and you don’t need permanent residency status to apply¹².\n",
      "TD offers a range of credit card options for Canadian newcomers via its specially designed New to Canada package, but they particularly mention the Cash Back and Rewards Visa cards¹³.\n",
      "For both of these, you just need to be a resident, not a permanent resident, and they don’t charge an annual fee. The credit limit can be as low as $500¹⁴ ¹⁵. The difference is in the name: the Cash Back card gives you 0.5% cash back on all purchases and 1% on eligible groceries and gas¹⁴, while the Rewards card lets you earn points – 1 per dollar most of the time; 2 on groceries, restaurants, and bills; and 3 via a special deal with Expedia – that you can redeem on Amazon.ca¹⁵.\n",
      "It’s possible to get both of those TD credit cards, plus a number of others, as secured cards. That way, for an initial deposit, you can raise your credit limit and build your credit history in Canada even further.1³\n",
      "Talking of secured credit cards, a couple more are worth a look for newcomers to Canada. The first is the Home Trust Secured Visa. You pay a deposit of between $500 and $10,000, and that amount then becomes your credit limit. There’s no annual fee if you’re OK with a 19.99% interest rate, or you can pay $59 annually for a reduced interest rate of 14.9%. It’s not available in Quebec¹⁶.\n",
      "The whole thing is designed so that you can build your credit rating up, so it’s a better option if that’s likely a particular concern for you. You don’t get bagfuls of points or cash back, but once your credit rating’s improved, maybe you’ll be able to do that in the future.\n",
      "Another secured credit card designed to help you build your credit rating is offered by Refresh Financial. With this Visa, your credit limit can be as low as $200 (or as high as $10,000), for an annual fee of $12.95 and a maintenance fee of $3 a month¹⁷.\n",
      "There’s no credit check at all, so as long as you can pay the deposit, you’ll be able to get hold of one¹⁷. Although of course you should make sure you’re able to cover the fees as well.\n",
      "There’s a lot of variety in the list above, and that’s inevitable: newcomers to Canada take many different forms. If you’re arriving in Canada with a well-paying job already sorted and no concerns about residency status, you’ll want one sort of credit card. If you lack savings or are on a temporary visa, you’ll probably need another.\n",
      "This article has just looked at credit cards, which are often the financial product you interact with the most on a daily basis. But remember that the card is only part of a bigger picture too. Especially given that so many Canadian banks offer package deals to new immigrants in the country, do consider whether there are advantages to using the same provider for both personal banking and your credit card.\n",
      "Do you need a credit card at all?Prepaid cards are another option that reduce the risk of running up debt. But of course, if you want to build up a good credit rating, prepaid cards generally don’t help with that.\n",

      "If you’re a newcomer to Canada, you’ll need a few things to get a credit card. Namely, you’ll need to be the age of majority in your province or territory (typically 18 or 19 years of age) and to be a permanent resident or citizen of Canada. There are some cards that cater to international students and temporary foreign workers, however, they are usually secured or prepaid card.\n",
      "For higher end credit cards, you’ll typically need a good credit score or above. However, many cards catered to newcomers, including the cards on this list, are available to those with a low credit score or minimal credit history.\n",
      "While there are manycards with no annual feeavailable in Canada, some do carry an annual fee. Typically, $150 is the standard annual fee.\n",
      "Many Canadiancredit cards offer rewardson your annual spending, in the form of points or miles. Some cards offercash back,giving you a percentage of your spending back.\n",
      "A secured credit card requires a security deposit that corresponds to your limit (for example, a $1000 limit would require a $1000 deposit). An unsecured credit card requires no deposit and the limit is based on what you qualify for. Most people prefer to use an unsecured credit card, since there are more options available and it frees up your deposit money. If you only qualify for a secured card, it can help you build your credit score so long as it reports to the credit bureaus. Over time, you can build your credit score so that you can apply for an unsecured credit card.\n",
      "To apply for a credit card in Canada as a newcomer, you may need any of the following:\n",
      "They may also ask you for other documentation like information about your other credit cards or employment status.\n",
      "One of the simplest ways to establish a credit history as a newcomer is to start using a credit card responsibly. Paying your bills on time and paying off other debts or lines of credit are other ways to establish credit.\n",
      "When you’re looking for a secured credit card, you want one that you will be qualified for, has a security deposit you can afford and reports to the credit bureaus, as to establish credit history. Aside from that, you may look into a secured credit card that earns rewards, like points or cash back.\n",
      "When you’re looking to choose a secured credit card, there are a few questions to ask yourself, including:\n",
      "Establishing and maintaining a good credit history is a crucial step towards achieving financial stability and independence. Your credit history could be considered when renting a home, purchasing insurance, taking out a car loan or mortgage and even, when applying for a job.\n",
      "A secured credit card requires a security deposit, which differs from a prepaid card that deducts payments directly from your deposit. With a secured credit card, the security deposit doesn’t serve as the monthly payment. The other important difference is that a secured credit card can help build (or rebuild) a good credit history.\n",
      "Given the choice between a secured or unsecured credit card, there are usually good reasons to choose the unsecured credit card. For example, they tend to have lower rates and fees. But both secured and unsecured credit cards can be a powerful tool for improving or establishing a credit history.\n",
      "Yes. Any time you anticipate using your credit card outside of Canada, it is a good idea to let your credit card company know so that your charges are not declined. Be aware, however, that many credit cards charge aforeign transaction feeeach time you use your credit card abroad.\n",
      "Forbes Advisor’s pick for the best credit card for new immigrants in Canada is the Home Trust Secured Visa Credit Card. However, finding the card that’s best for you, like one that helps you build credit or has a low annual fee and earns rewards, depends on what you value.\n",
      "Yes, newcomers can get a credit card in Canada. However, since they have a short credit history, they’re limited as to what they can qualify for.\n",
      "Typically, secured and prepaid credit cards are the easiest to get in Canada. There are many cards on the market that cater to those withbad (or limited) credit histories.\n",
