Just got let-go,"Hi all,

Making this post on behalf of my GF.

She has just been let go from her job after working there for 11 month (company is going out of business).

This was her first job out of school (we’re 25). She (and I), have little to no savings built up. We live in downtown Toronto. I make $65K a year, she was making just under $50K.

What are the immediate steps she (or we) should be taking?

We are very very stressed about this situation. Thank you so much!

Ps: if you know companies in need of AMs/CSMs let me know! She’ll definitely be applying asap.",PersonalFinanceCanada,Skinnyyungwheatbread,1708630461.0,253,280,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1axfd8t/just_got_letgo/
"My investment in a restaurant has been very lucrative, what should be my next steps? ","I invested $250,000 into my childhood friend’s dad’s new restaurant location with 70% ownership and my friend with 30% ownership. My actual investment is 80% but I gave him 10% extra because he’s doing basically all the work, I’m just popping in every other day or sometimes one bi-weekly. His dad runs a very famous restaurant and already has 3 locations in Toronto. My friend suggested opening a restaurant in Brampton because a lot of customers come all the way to their location for the food, so I offered to invest. His dad and him did literally all the work, I just put in the money and so far it’s been going surprisingly well. In 2023, he managed to make almost $200,000 in profit. He reinvested some (with my approval) back into the business and bonuses to employees, so actual profit is around $170,000. I got $115,000 and he got $51,000 + $25,000 in salary. I still work a regular job (HVAC tech) and made $130,000 in 2023 (base pay is $48, so I work OT regularly). My expenses are pretty minimal, around $1,800/month as I live with parents, and have zero debt. I’ve $70,000 in my TFSA (WS auto investor),  $30,000 in checking, and $150,000 in TD savings account.

"Collected HST but earned less than $30,000","I registered with CRA as a sole proprietor (freelance writer) and have been charging clients HST on my invoices. I’ve been collecting the HST in a separate account. I just filed my quarterly return and it was assessed as owing $0. My total sales for the quarter was less than $30,000.  So my question is what happens to the HST I collected? Does it become my earnings, or am I to send this back to CRA some other way ?

American Express cancelled our Amex Platinum with over 100k AR points for no reason. They are refusing to reinstate it. HELP!,"Hi PFC,

We (wife and I) have had the AMEX Platinum for around 6 months. We moved all our expenses from the SimplyCash Preferred to the Platinum. We've been collecting Amex points all this time, even booked our honeymoon on this card.

In Nov, we cancelled the Amex Simply Cash Preferred after paying off the card in full. Cancellation was painless but then we got a bill for \~$10 which was the monthly fee. We called Amex and asked them to refund this amount as the card was cancelled. 

Amex confirmed on the phone that there was nothing to worry about that and that this amount ($10) will be reversed/waived. Fast forward to this week when we get a letter from Amex saying that we have a balance of $10 outstanding and that if we do not pay then they would send it to collections. WTF? It made no sense to us as we had cancelled the SimplyCash card and our Amex Platinum was always paid on time. We were going to call Amex this weekend. 

Last night my wife tried to use the Platinum and it was declined. Confused, we call them today to ask why the card was declined. Amex tells us that the card has been cancelled. They again tell us they will reverse the $10 that was supposedly outstanding from the SimplyCash but they cannot do anything about the cancelled Amex Platinum??? This makes no sense to us. Our Platinum card was in good standing, we had no balance on it and over 100k Amex points that we never got to use. We keep asking to escalate the matter and we are being told ""no one can reinstate the card"". WTF!!

This is absolutely HORRIFIC customer experience from Amex. Their own agents told us that the $10 would be reversed. Now they have cancelled our Platinum for what reason?! Please help as we are at our wits end having spent hours on the phone with Amex already getting bounced from one department to another back to the same department. We do not want to lose the 100k  points that we had been saving up to visit family. Who do we complain to?? OBSI?? FCAC?? Reach out to the media??

"When a spouse dies, what is considered part of their estate and what is automatically owned by the surviving spouse?","I'm asking this question with respect to outstanding debts that the deceased spouse has that are not jointly owned by the surviving one.  If the deceased has unsecured debts like personal loans or credit cards that are solely in their name, can any part of the marital property be considered part of the estate and forced to be used to pay those debts?  Let's assume one spouse has $100k in credit card debts and the couple owns their home with a mortgage value of half of it and owns 3 cars and a boat worth $150k together.  What happens?  Assume there is no insurance on the mortgage or anything else.  I know that the mortgage is backed by the house and therefore does not go away.  What about the rest of it?  does any of the property become part of the estate used to pay those debts or does the surviving spouse just own all of it and those debts go away?

Was laid off back in October new job not going well ,"I 36m was laid off from a great job back in October, very quickly I contacted a recruiter and I had 3 offers within 3 weeks and was back working at the beginning of November. 

Things at the new job have not been going well, it’s a different industry than what I am familiar with but the same role (went from Saas sales to SRED consulting sales) 

I have basically been pitted in competition with the guy who was supposed to train me, I did not get a lot of training and the owner has offered little to no direction, and to be fair I haven’t produced the results they wanted and I can understand the way things are in sales I suspect they will be getting rid of me soonish if not tomorrow.

Accidentally claimed all my unused tuition credits ,"Hello everyone,

I recently filed my taxes, and it’s the first time where I haven’t made under $30k per year as I finished my education and started a job in late 2022. So I was used to large tax refunds. 

However I was surprised when I got a 6.4K refund this year. It turns out I accidentally claimed all my unused tuition tax credits (~30,000). I don’t mind that this happened as I figure the money is better invested than just waiting, but is this allowed? Will CRA come after me? My original interpretation is that you could only use these credits to bring your amount owed to zero, but maybe I misunderstood.

CEBA Loan Consequences ,"A friend of mine, like many other Canadian business owners took out a $60,000 CEBA Loan. They have not paid any of it back so there goes the free $20,0000. 

They are ignoring calls from the CRA. 

How is this going to play out? When do they stop calling and start knocking and seizing assets to have this debt collected?

I'm worried about them and as they don't even want to talk about it. I just want some clarity of what to expect for them.

* From 2006 to 2021, Canada saw a 20% decrease in investment per worker in Canadian firms.
* Large and medium-sized firms showed more evidence of this decline than smaller firms.
* Of the decline, 30% was seen to be coming from foreign-controlled firms, rather than domestically controlled firms.
* Entry rates (the percentage of new firms per year) also declined from 2006 to 2021, from 12% to 7%.

Bad with Money and Looking For Help?,"I (28F) think I have become very bad with money and I was hoping someone could help me look into my current spending habits and recommend a realistic budget improvement plan? 

My monthly paycheque is around 4,700 after deductions

My monthly expenses are:
Mortgage and property taxes: $2,350
Utilities: $250-$400 depending on the month, currently on the higher end 
Internet and phone plan : $140
Home, pet, and car insurance: $280 total
Gas: $200 - no maintenance fees, I do everything myself.
Going out: $200ish
Gifts (seems like there’s a birthday, baby shower, bridal shower, housewarming, bachelorette, or “optional” office activities every month)- $150
Groceries: $500
Takeout: $150-$200 (around once a week)
Dog and cat food: $50
Misc. items (like clothes, makeup, house stuff, car stuff, small appliances, occasional vet bills ): $300 -$400 if you average it out throughout the months 
Vacation: I try to save up every other year for a trip 

I currently have $2,000 in a locked GIC, I have no savings, RRSP, or TSFA. I always keep at least $1,000 in my chequing account but it doesn’t seem to grow.

I feel like I am living paycheque to paycheque despite having a fairly good job and I am one big expense away from going into debt… my car is paid off, phone is paid off, student loans paid off, but it doesn’t feel like any of that matters.

Can anyone let me know how I could get my finances in order and save more money in the next 3-5 years? I think I will need a new car by then, and I would like to save up for it.

Edit: I see a lot of comments regarding my high mortgage/utility bills. Could anyone comment on wether I am biting off more than I could chew?

Kinda paralyzed as to where to put my money. ,"Received a settlement from a car accident in the amount of 500k. I am a married 55(m). Spouse is 57. 

Mortgage is up for renewal in two months, there will be about 85k left and I would like to pay it off in full. Bought the house for 200k in 2009 currently valued at 550k.  I look at it as a guaranteed 6%(or close to)return and the peace of mind of being mortgage free is enticing. 


We have no CC debt. 
Wife’s car is paid off and mine, $380/month @ 1.5% interest is finished come July. It’s cheap enough that I see no point in paying it off early. 

HELOC is about 14k. Bank may ask for that to be paid if there is no mortgage, not sure how that works.  Will sort that out before mortgage term ends. 

Income:

I am unable to return to work as a commercial electrician. As such I collect:

 CPP-D $1085/month (taxable) 
LTD $1650 (non taxable)
Income Replacement Benefit $1110 (non taxable).  These are guaranteed amounts until age 65, 9.5 more years. 

Spouse makes about 4K/month after taxes.  

Retirement Savings:

Approximately 180k between us. 

From the 500kI have opened a Wealth Simple account and have done the following to start:

80k into a TFSA for myself. Will add another 15k to max out room. Only bought 1500 in XEQT so far.  The remainder I am unsure of how to distribute within the TFSA itself and am seeking advice. 

I have put 10K in RRSP on WS. 

380K is just sitting in my WS cash account so I can at least get 4.5% while I get my shit together with a plan. 

Short term goals, want to do a little work on the house, I peg those at about 50K. 

I want to max out my wife’s TFSA, she has the full 95k room available. 

I’m not sure if it is worth putting money into RRSP with our current ‘low’ taxable incomes. 

I do want to see some growth with this money and would like my wife to quit work in 3 years. 

Our investment horizon, for growth, is short and I am leaning towards safe investments. We don’t live too flashy. Like to travel a couple times a year and have always lived within our means. 

If you were me, what would you do with this windfall, for lack of a better term.

ACL Tear Is Ruining Me Financially,"I quit my job to go to school full time. At the time I had some light knee pain but didn’t think much of it. 

A month later I re-aggravate the injury and fully tear my acl with a severe miniscus tear.

I got caught in a limbo where my previous job would’ve covered surgery,mri,physio and income replacement but instead I have none of it covered and no disposable money. 

I was denied for student loans to help me this semester because I took 3 classes instead of 4 (wish I knew I would need them) and lost my current source of money (being a hockey referee). 

I applied for EI (Injury) but with my luck odds are low. They are taking a long time to process my file it’s been 3 weeks. I can no longer switch to online classes. 

So here’s the issue,

I now have a near maxed out credit balance 1.3k.

2k in tuition overdue at 18% interest 

2-3 a week physio at 100$ a session (which I’m currently not doing even with a prescription because I cant). 

A couple tickets coming due totalling 1k. 

No current way to do anything whatsoever in terms of making an income unless I manage to make money online instantly in the next month. Can’t drive Uber since I injured my right knee. 

No income, no family members who can help (living with my parents they try their best but already my room doesn’t have electrify and our sink/dishwasher doesn’t work. They have other priorities) 

I can’t tank my credit like it’s gonna get tanked.

Spouses Therapy costs unsustainable.,"My Partner is a survivor of child sex trafficking & was trafficked to about 7 men (probably more, but this is what she remembers so far) while also being abused by her father and siblings over the span of an 9-10 year period. Not trying to pull any heart strings, just emphasizing that the therapy feels truly necessary.

She has a criminal case ongoing against her father which is reaching a culmination point, and with all this being so close to the surface of her mind due to that she has been needing specialized Psychotherapy with increased frequency to the tune of $200/week.

My benefits cover $3000 per year of Paramedical expenses, but those will run out for the year at the beginning of april at current consumption rates at which point I will need to pay for her Therapy out of pocket.

We'll either need to decrease therapy which just drags the mental suffering on longer, or forgoe 8000-10000$ a year to get her the help she needs.

None of this is tax deductible so far as I know  & she does not have a family doctor to refer to programs covered by OHIP (we are residents of Ontario), and we're unsure about if she could qualify for the disability tax credit.

I've been told there are grants available for survivors of child sex assault and trafficking, but have been unable to find where she can apply for them, are these something administered through the court process after the criminal case?

Pension buyback ,"I’m considering whether it’s worth it to buyback years of service from my pension. I’m 29. I can buy back approx 3 years of service for $44k. This amount will not be matched by the employer. 

Everyone I’ve talked to says this is a good idea. It’s a DB pension, and I’m not overly concerned right now that anything will go south with this pension. 

I’m struggling with the math. The estimate that the pension organization gave me was that this would add roughly $230 to my pension payments at retirement. 

If I invest the 44k today, over the next 25 years @7% it comes out to $188,000. At a safe 4% withdrawal rate that gives me $626/month.

Disability Tax Credit transfer from dependent parent to caregiving child - going in circles with CRA,"My Father-in-law suffers from dementia and was approved for DTC by CRA for 2015 and future years. We submitted T2201 in late summer 2023 and received the notice of determination in November 2023. My father-in-law became a permanent resident of Canada in March 2022 and submitted his first tax return for the year 2022. His total income as per the only NOA issued to him is nil. His federal and Ontario non-refundable tax credits are $3,344 and $837 respectively.

My questions are as follows

\- How can we request to transfer his DTC credits to his daughter, my wife? We tried to include the information in section 2, 3 and 4 of part A of T2201. We also wrote them separate letters of authorization from my father-in-law and also from my wife, requesting the transfer of credits (which I presume would trigger a notice of reassessment for my wife). We call CRA and they give a new suggestion every time. Once we received DTC approval, I expected the process to be smooth afterwards, but dealing with CRA has been frustrating.

\- If my father-in-law started filing his taxes from 2022 onwards in Canada, how would the credits be applied retroactively? After the transfer of credits does happen, should we be expecting to apply for refunds for 2022 and beyond or all the way back from 2015?

YTD income timeline,"Hi, I have a question regarding YTD income timeline/T4 on behalf of my wife. The companies payroll is done from an independent accountant - not in house.

She brought this to my attention the other day that for her December 2023 pay all the YTD/cpp/ei was all reset back to 0 (as in a normal company/person would see for January). Now she has been issued her T4 and it also only states the income to end of November - to just before everything was reset to 0 (like a new year). So for anything financial this makes things very confusing as it is not a true 2023 income or a future 2024/YTD income.

Not sure if the above can be easily understood but it's basically like they are running the year (ytd) from December to November instead of January to December.

Is this even legal/normal for other companies? I can't understand why a company would do this besides making everything confusing and possible improper personal tax calculations (couldn't think of the word I was wanting to use here).

Taxes/tfsa to rrsp,"I have about 850$ in my tfsa. I started with 740$ a few months ago and it grew till 850$ now. This is in Wealthsimple

I’m worried about having to pay taxes soon though. should I sell my 850$ stocks in tfsa and then use the funds to buy stocks in rrsp? 

Thanks,

Edit: sorry I missed lots of info. In Quebec 

My income for 2023, I roughly estimated it to be around 38,000 (this was when I was graduating so I think I have “tuition” tax credit for just one semester) and it was hard to estimate my income bc I had worked like 2 stable jobs and then 2 side jobs during school. 

But yeah in total, it’s about 38,000 for work income. Then I had went on EI for like 2-3 months which complicates things even more so I think including EI, my “income” might add up to about 45k but again, not too sure. The lowest tax bracket for Quebec is 49k so I’m hoping to get below 49k so that I will fall into the 14% tax. If I end up with over 49 k, it will be like 19% tax. 

One of my main jobs has an RRSP program, I think I have about 1200$ in that. There’s also a DPSP in that same jobs rrsp program and the dpsp is like 800$ but I don’t think the dpsp will be taxable? 

Yeah so that’s the big picture. I haven’t been able to save much bc when I graduated, I had about 10–11k in credit card debt. I’m paying it down and now I’m at 7900. 

I also have student loan of 29K and I haven’t started repaying any of it, currently it’s deferred until April so the gov pays the interest until April but then I’ll have to start paying it off.

"Didn’t use my TD bank account for more than a year, what happened to my overdraft?","Hi! So I left Canada in April 2022 and didn’t come back there. I used to live there for about 3 years as a student and had a debit card and a student checking account . Before I left I forgot to pay off my overdraft which was I think close to 300 cad. I just now remembered that.. I’m wondering what happened to it now? Since I didn’t close my account and well I can’t call them or access my account anymore since my phone number is long changed. last time I checked it was in 2022 fall and it seemed to have disappeared and a new checking account was there with just a balance of -3 cad I payed off the -3 and it just went back to 0 and then I lost access since the phone number was taken by someone. I am wondering if they are still taking fees for the account and if I still have that overdraft and what happened to it? Thank you!

Gathering info for deductions ,"Hello,

I'm trying to gather info for deductions on income taxes. I live in Alberta. 

For Medical deductions is there an easy way to gather totals I.e. to contact you dentist/ pharmacy and have them send a receipt of your purchases with a total through the year? 

I have tried to ask my pharmacy (Loblaws) for a income tax receipt but the totals don't seem to be in line with what I actually paid. 

I also pay for healthcare plan at work am I able to claim some of that on my income taxes? 

Any other deductions that would be recommended?

Typical financing for home additions or updates?,"Hey all, just wondering what the typical financing options are for home additions or other renovations? We’re entertaining the idea of seeking permits to add a storey to our house, which would unlock some great mountain views. Do people typically save all the funds for projects like this? Use  a basic line of credit? Or is there some sort of more affordable mortgage-like financing available when you’re adding value to a home?

Also, same question but not for an addition, but instead a kitchen update & some structural changes. I’m guessing there might be a difference if it’s a more subjective update where we’re remodeling but not adding square footage or some other verifiable value add to the home?

Best way to fund unexpected home repairs? ,"We live in a 170 year old barn conversion that, up until recently, hasn’t given us any difficulties in the six years since we purchased. Suddenly, everything is breaking. Most urgently, we’ve had a serious issue with the pipes backing up, both in the house and heading out to the street. The long and short is that we’re going to need about 12k to fix the problem. 

Here is my question: Do we bankroll this with a HELOC or a TD line of credit? Is there another better option? 

To put a plainly, we don’t have the money to do this repair and it is critical. (We literally have filthy sewage water back flowing through ceilings onto furniture and coming up through our sinks so we can’t sit on this decision either). It’s an incredibly shitty situation - pun intended. 

Since Covid, our finances have taken a huge hit. We have incredibly meagre savings and $5500 in a line of credit debt that we’ve been trying to pay off. We are doing incredibly well with reducing our existing debt and have a great financial plan in place to get us on track and recoup our savings.

We’ve been working so hard, selling items on marketplace, both picking up extra work where we can, living VERY frugally etc. This is a huge and unexpected hit. We are not in a position to renegotiate our mortgage. 

I would be so grateful for any ideas or suggestions on how to best pay for unexpected home repairs with zero savings to apply towards the work.

Should I buy out my lease?,"I splurged on a semi-luxury vehicle for the first time in my life after driving base models (stick shift, no ac, etc) and used cars since I was 17 (which helped me save a lot of money through school and buying my home). After a few years into my job I felt I could comfortably “splurge” on a 2020 Volvo. Now my lease is up and I owe $32k (all in) to buy it out. I have spent around $24k on it via the lease and I’m not sure if it is a good or bad financial decision to buy it out.  It’s the base model but it has everything I need at the moment. I opted to lease the car originally because I owned my own business so it was a tax right off at the time but I’m thinking of shutting down the business this year (keeping my full time job).

1. I understand that what this essentially means is I can buy shares/options at a lower price today. And then if the company goes public and trades the shares at a higher price, I can then sell them. Is this correct?

2..What happens if the company is sold to/acquired by another company instead of going public?

3. These options vest over a 3 year period. What if I leave before the 3 year period ends? Do I still get to keep the amount that vested or is it an all or nothing kind of scenario?

"Get a car, get a closer job, or continue suffering?","Hi all,

I'm 3 months into a good job, where the commute is 90 minutes by bus. I have to get up at 4am, which means I can't stay out past 8pm on a worknight.  To have more energy and time, I could get a car or switch jobs. Moving is a last resort. The job is part time, because I prioritize my interests outside of work, and I make more than enough money for my lifestyle.

All of my coworkers have cars, but I am reluctant. Cars are expensive, polluting, and the best part about living in Toronto is that it's not car dependent. My budget for a car would be max $300 per month, excluding gas.

Switching jobs now might not be wise, because my previous jobs all lasted <1 year for various reasons (got an offer closer to family, management went crazy, coworkers refused to use PPE & tracked very dangerous chemicals all over the lab). I was never laid off, but it does look suspicious. A future hiring manager might see that job history and rule me out. If left, I could continue to work casually at my current place, which might look better on the resumé than leaving them entirely.

If changing jobs or getting a car aren't smart moves, I shall continue to suffer. This is the life I have chosen by electing to work 3 days per week. 

Thoughts?

Does buying a TFSA GIC affect contribution room?,"I have maxed out my TFSA contribution room. It was only lately that I ventured out to purchase a TFSA GIC. I understand how contribution room works and why I need to wait for the next calendar year to replace the amount I withdraw this year. I also thought that purchasing a TFSA GIC works just like how withdrawals and deposits are done on a TFSA.

So in preparation for the TFSA GIC 14-month non-redeemable purchase, in the middle of December of 2023, I withdrew $50,000 from my TFSA Savings Account in anticipation of a January 2024 purchase. My original plan was to purchase the $50,000 TFSA GIC from my normal savings account (*thus replacing the freed up contribution room*).

However, in the middle of January 2024, the Personal Banker at TD advised me to deposit the $50,000 back to my TFSA Savings account , and then they could initiate the purchase of the TFSA GIC. I was resistant during that time but I let her do it in the end because she said if it didn't come from the TFSA, then it wouldn't be a TFSA GIC.

My concern is when I deposited the money back to the TFSA Savings Account, I used up the $50,000 that was freed up in December. For the purchase of the TFSA GIC, $50,000 was then withdrawn (*it shows the transaction as a withdrawal on the statement*) from my TFSA Savings Account and then deposited/transferred to the new TFSA GIC account. **Could that mean a $50,000 overcontribution**?

When I asked the Personal Banker about this, her reply was *""The transfer that we did into the TFSA is considered part of your contribution that you withdrew in December. The purchase of the GIC is not considered a transfer.""* I don't exactly know what she means by that.

I want to sell my financed car - what do you recommend?,"I purchased a brand new car in May of 2022 that was supposed to be primarily for work but the company shut down in November. I no longer need such a big car (SUV), and I don't want to have car payments. I have about $12K saved to buy a small car that is good on gas.   
Long story short, I used to drive a company vehicle since 2021, the company early last year removed that program and asked us to get our own vehicles (comparable to the Chevy Equinox we drove) and they offered a $875 car allowance instead. Good enough to cover the monthly payments + insurance.  They also provided a gas card, so that was not an issue either.   
**Car Details:**   
2022 Ford Bronco Sport Big Bend AWD (did not add anything fancy)   
Current Mileage: 15,500 km   
Accident free  
Oil change/maintenance done at Ford recently 

**Ford Credit Info (I am in AB)**   
Principal Balance: $39,148.89  
Monthly Payments: $590   
APR: 3.99% --> reason why I bought this car. It was the lowest rate I could find. Rates on used cars at the time were close to 10%. And it was impossible to find decently priced/in good shape SUVs.   
Term: 84 months   
Remaining: 75 months   
Next payment: March 18 

For what I can see online, most are listed through dealerships and are going for $36,990 + tax (same year/model/low mileage). If financed, most rates are 8.99% 

**What would be the smartest way to sell it?**   
\-Ford said someone can take over the finance payments. The buyer keeps the same interest rate. Ford charges $450 to do the transfer of documents. Who pays for this, the seller or buyer?  
\-Trade-in value Ford gave me is $32K - so not great   
\-If I sell it privately, how would that work? I don't have $39K laying around to pay out the car in full and then wait to get paid. I don't know how that would look like. It seems very complicated.

Realtor taking advantage of grandfathers dementia- what can I do? ," For context my grandparents owned 2 houses. The one I live in, and theirs. So, 

 a little over a year ago (December 2022) some real estate lady had been talking to my grandfather and convinced him to take out a double mortgage (one on each) to buy new house. Unfortunately, he didn’t tell my granny and just bought it. They charged them a fortune for “moving” (which the lady and her son did herself, for $3000). Within a month, she broke her hip tripping in it, and said she hated it. They sold it for a loss. Couple months later she died. Then my grandpa hired them AGAIN to go through my granny’s stuff and put it in boxes. This lady was always around. Checking on my grandpa. Doing all sorts of extras. They would eat together. (The real estate lady… and her son… and some other lady who wasn’t related to them)

Fast foreward to now, and I’ve used my inheritance to buy the house I’m in for the price of the mortgage.  90k on a 250k+ house. Owned fully. Grandpa needed her to lowball the value of the house for tax purposes, so she came and appraised it for about 50k~ less. During which, she made a statement like “oh well get to that” when talking about the state of my roof. Like she wasn’t done with us. 

I come to find out yesterday, this woman is now driving my grandpa around looking for new houses. For a third comission. 

So aside from the fact I’ve had to buy back what was supposed to be my inheritance because of this woman taking advantage of my grandfather who has dementia, she is now planning on selling his property as well. I don’t want to seem greedy like “oh no my inheritance” but as the last line in the family, with no cousins, brothers, or anyone other than me and my mom to inherit, it is my business. Especially if he is having dementia. 

I’m not sure if I can add her name for others to say whether or not they’ve experience her before - she’s a mother-son real estate team.

I'm still young (23yo) and I have a bit of money set aside, but I would like to not all use it for my car payment. I currently have a 618$/month car payment and 500$/month rent. I still own 36k$ on the car. The industry I was working in (mining) is tanking a bit. I might be able to find a job outside of the mining industry but with significantly lower paying wages (Around 65k-75k a year). 

What should I do? Can I sell the car even tho I own money on it? It's worth less than what I own so that would be a problem

Should I trade it for something cheaper? 

What are my options?

Thank you

Car Collision Claim,"Not sure where else to discuss this.

3 hours ago someone swiped the front left side bumper of my 2022 model 3. This caused paint damage and the wheel well was dented out. The incident was captured on camera.

I took the at fault parties contact information and insurance information. They said they'll pay for the damages, but they said not to contact their insurance since they already have an accident on their record.

The repair may take a long time (e.g.., a week to a month, maybe more). I'd be out of a car that entire time. I'd rather their insurance cover that. Also, if I go through insurance, would this show up on the vehicle's record (and I wouldn't be able to recover diminished resale value)?

Is taking a sabbatical in my 20s worth it?,"Not going to lie, reading some of the posts on the /travel subreddit and stories from my friends might’ve rubbed off me, but I (26M) have been at my first full time job for 4.5 years now (eng firm) out of university and I’m having a bit of a dilemmna on if I should do that one “big” trip to travel in your 20s. 

Our company allows for 1-6 month sabbaticals, and it would still pay 10% of your salary while you’re gone. However since I’m still kind of new in my professional career, would doing this (for ex. By 5 years mark) be harmful for my career? I have about $107k saved up ($25k liquid) and would like to travel either Europe or Asia.

I’m terrified to spend money,"I’m 28 and I have no debt but I have this constant fear that I am behind in everything financially (Retirement, savings, salary, home down payment etc.) and as a result I never spend money on anything that isn’t a need. This has caused me to not really do much but work and go home and I feel like I should try to live a little but then I always talk myself out of it because the money would be more efficient somewhere else. I currently put 30% of income into retirement, then the rest is mostly savings unless I need something. 

My parents went bankrupt twice before I turned 10 and we lived in poverty so I never developed a need for material things. I always think of every purchase as “man, imagine if this $20 was put into retirement instead of this movie ticket”. 

I currently make 75k/yr, have 28k in retirement and have 10k in savings.

How do I find a way to experience life for once? I don’t really have any friends as a result of this because I never put myself out there.

Thanks in advance!

Counselor’s office charged me $280 to print off a 6 page word document. ,"In 2022 I year I got some ADHD testing done. In the intake session, the counselor (or therapist?)  explained that that after the testing I’d get a copy of the results sent to my house and that they would be sent to my psychiatrist as well. The testing was finished in Jan of 2022, and I paid it in full. 

My psychiatrist never initially received the copy, and so they had to reach out to the counselor. Eventually they got it. But by OCT 2022, I realized I still hadn’t gotten my copy, so I called the office and picked it up. A few weeks later, I was hit with a $280 bill for “test report Neuro” and “test report Neuro additional.” 

I called the office expecting this to be an error and to get some clarity, and she told me that was the bill for that report. Mind you -this report is very brief, 6 one-sided pages -and I was supposed to get a copy several months earlier, after I went through testing. 

They’ve sent me countless bills for it. Oddly enough the report has the Oct 2022 date on it, as if they never wrote it initially, and only wrote it up when I asked for it. 

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? I have a great credit score and no other outstanding bills, but I’m not in a position where I can pay $280 for a word document. Their office has a few reviews with similar complains from patients, and I can’t help but feel I’m being scammed.

"Just had baby number 2 last week, husband is considering quitting a miserable job, and we want to know if we are protected enough financially to validate quitting without another job","Hi guys -

Thank you so much for reading this already.  I hope this post is okay to layout, but I just had a baby and having 3rd party people look at this with me is absolutely priceless.  So thank you so very much in advanced.  

To make a really long story short, my husband's company is treating him like garbage, and he is ready to quit because of it (I am in support of this).   

We just had baby number 2 last Monday, and his company would not allow him to take any unpaid time off to be here for us.   So he is burning through all of the measly 10 days off (sick AND PTO) he has for the year in order to spend that time with us.  AND even though he is off, he is still working 4+ hours a day because his company won't stop reaching out to him..  He has been getting yelled at for spending time with his new baby and me, he is getting berated for doing women's work for staying home.  FOR BARELY ANY TIME MIND YOU.  They were calling him while he was in the delivery room with me.

His boss screamed at him on Monday for taking this time.  Y'all his work isn't life or death.  He manages a machine shop.  There are no major projects going on.  I just think they are mad at him for spending any time with his new baby.. for some reason? He graduated Suma Cum Laude in Mechanical Engineering 3 years ago, but has been in the industrial manufacturing industry for 10 years.  (we are both in our early 30s)

We are trying to decide if we are safe enough financially to have him quit outright and spend the next few months looking for a job where the company isn't so hostile.  (this is just the straw that broke the camels back mind you, this place is absolutely awful - I'm just going to stop here in the interest of getting onto the financials)

**Income information -** 

\- Husband (the one looking to quit) - $85k base salary annually, no bonus, no 401k, benefits are all through me. After taxes this works out to about $5k per month take home. 

\- Wife (me) - total compensation of $230k ($170k base salary annually, 18.5% annual bonus which hits at end of march, 30k stock grant bonus).  After taxes, and all our benefits, 10% to 401k, money in HSA, ESPP, etc. it works out to be about $6,600 per month take home.  

I graduated from a top 5 school in my field, and the odds of me losing my job are basically 0.  Last time I went on maternity leave, the company gave me $85k in a bonus just so I would come back.  I work for a 5 billion dollar company, so I do think my job is about as secure as it could be. 

**Expenses/debt information -**

\- We are in only in debt on our home, of which we owe $220,000 at a 3.5% interest rate.  

\- Our Non-discretionary expenses (gas, water, electric, etc) work out to be about $3,200 per month including our mortgage. 

\- Our first kid's daycare is $1,600 per month (I did not include this on the previous line)

\- Our new baby will start daycare in May for an additional $1,800 per month 

So Im calculating that until May, if we live off my salary alone - we will have about $1,800 left over for all kid expenses, diapers, food and everything else.   I do calculate that if I take a break on contributing to my 401k, HSA and ESPP - I would get an additional $2k back for expenses if need be.  I would think that's not wise though if possible... 

Once May hits though, we will have the additional $1,800 expense and if my husband hasn't found work by that point, we will have to start burning through savings for all expenses until he does.  

**Savings/Investments/Major Assets -** 

\- In cash we have about $30k on hand

\- My 401k - $115k

\- My husband's 401k from a previous employer - $50k

\- Stock in my company - $250k of which I have $100k vested

\- Our home value - $700k

\- HSA - $2k (we just burned through it to have a baby)

\- General investment portfolio - $316k 

&#x200B;

**My train of thought -** 

I feel like we have done a good job investing and saving.  I think for a few months, we could safely pause on our 401k and other investments in order to have more cash on hand to support my husband looking for a new job.  That would mean that we have about $3,800 to live off of monthly for non-discretionary expenses.   

The other reason we are really wanting to do this is that we have never and probably will never have time like this together again.  I am on paid maternity leave for 12 weeks, and if he quits.. we can both be home with our kids until he finds work.  That time would be completely priceless to us.  We hardly ever get any vacations or time together as a family.

I really sincerely thank anyone reading this who is helping us think through it, we are both exhausted from sleepless nights with the newborn and a well-rested 3rd party is just so appreciated.

Home inspection revealed significant damage to home I am desperately trying to sell.,"In February of 2020, my wife and I purchased a home for $270k in a medium cost of living city. The house was being flipped when we bought it, and the seller was a bit shady throughout the purchasing process, but we had an inspection done and everything came back fine minus the roof being near the end of its life, so we proceeded. Since moving in, it was clear the seller took some shortcuts and the house has had some issues. Some flimsy drywall, some shoddy plumbing, etc. but nothing crazy. As of today, we still owe about $230k on the house. The area around the house has gone downhill a bit, there has been some crime and we have had some issues with the local school system. 

At the end of last year, my wife's father suffered some health issues and we decided it was in our best interest to move closer to him (about 1400 miles away) as it is a safer area with good schools, albeit a higher cost of living. We likely made this decision too quickly and signed a lease there at the beginning of December before having our house sold. We figured that with the real estate market being the way it has been, we should not have any issues selling it for a small profit or at least what we paid, but apparently we were wrong.

2 buyers have backed out after seeing the house and we had a 3rd who was very interested but just backed out after the home inspection. The inspection report states doors/windows are at the end of their expected life, wood rot, moisture damage, the back deck is unstable, floor joint damage, and the roof which we already knew about. Even had a cash buyer look at it and he said he wouldn't take it after looking at stuff himself. I regret ever buying the house and I feel doomed!

At this point, I just want to break even and be done with it. I don't have the extra funds to take a loss on the house, considering we are still paying the mortgage and the rent at out new place, and my wife is also working less to take care of her father. We are putting groceries on credit cards right now to get by. Is there anyway I can get out from the house??",PersonalFinance,AndrewLloydWeiner,1708614299.0,438,300,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ax8jtq/home_inspection_revealed_significant_damage_to/

When does it actually make sense to pay off mortgage early? I think I’m a candidate in this instance.  ,"Back in 2007 I made a poor choice to refinance an investment property with a variable APR. Since then, my financial picture has vastly improved.

"Advice needed. Target Credit Card Debt of $500 caused 2 bank accounts to be withdrawn over $6,000.","Hey everyone,  
  
I'm in a bit of a tough spot and could really use some advice. Recently, my mother-in-law found herself in a legal mess with Target over an old credit card debt that she had completely forgotten about. Here's the situation:  
  
About 7 to 10 years ago, my mother-in-law had a Target credit card with a balance of $500. Unfortunately, she lost her job around that time and was unable to keep up with her payments. As time went on, the debt slipped her mind entirely.  
  
Fast forward to now, and Target has taken legal action against her without her even knowing. They hired an attorney and took her to court over the unpaid debt. Shockingly, they managed to overdraft not one, but two of her bank accounts for a total of $2,900 and $2,700 to cover the debt and legal fees. To make matters worse, Target has frozen her bank accounts until she pays up.  
  
My mother-in-law is understandably stressed and overwhelmed by this situation, and frankly, so am I. It seems incredibly unfair that Target would take such aggressive action without even attempting to reach out to her first, especially considering the debt is so old.  
  
Has anyone been through a similar situation or have any advice on how to proceed? Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Parents can't get insurance on their new home,"Hi All

I hope this is the right place to post this.

My parents are buying a home in Washington State using all cash. They are selling their home in Minnesota.

They close in 1 week and an issue has arisen. They have made 2 insurance claims on the MN home in the last 5 years, both legitimate claims for under $10k. Now no insurance in WA will insure their new home. I know they technically don't need insurance but that seems like a terrible idea. The realtor is suggesting that they put the home in my name and I get insurance, I'm concerned about unforeseen risks.

I'm looking for advice:
Does anyone have any suggestions of how they can get insurance?

My intention was to get new cards that I could do balance transfers on but got denied,( probably because of how much debt I have).The 0 interest time is up on both (the 8K card just got its first interest charge of almost $200, the 10K card will start getting hit next month, so I’m thinking I want to just pay off the 8K one before the 1st of next month (8 days) so at least that one won’t get any more interest charged. That will leave me with around 3K left in my checking. 

What I’m wondering is, should I pay the total 8K once or something like 1k each day for the next 8 days? Does it make a difference? The other option I considered is just getting the 8K balance down to 2K and paying the 10K card down to 8K so I will still have two cards with significantly less owed on each.

Would you allow your landlord to do a formal review of your bank accounts and spending to renew your lease?,"We love the house we are living in!  It is a single family detached home in a nice neighborhood.  We are about reach the end of a two year lease.  The landlord wants us to stay but before approving a new lease he needs us to allow a renter/consumer background screening company to review our assets, spending, credit and cash flow. A true deep dive into our entire financial situation.

What do you think?  Would you agree to this?

***UPDATE a day later:  I told my my landlord that this was a total joke and would open us up for identity theft and take away our privacy.  My concern was rejected out of hand.***

Here is how it is described on their website linked below:

**The Payroll Verification & Cash Flow Report is the kind of tenant screening you have always hoped to see. Renters don’t pay their rent with their credit (most of the time) and hardly ever are their rent payments reported to the credit bureau. Our Payroll Verification & Cash Flow Report will reveal the ability to pay your rent by examining the last three months of their banking history.**

**The bank balance on the report will reveal the cash balance maintained in the applicant’s bank account(s) along with cash flows so you can judge if your applicant can afford your rent. The report will provide you with detailed deposits so you can verify employment and monthly income. This is a perfect report for a tenant who doesn’t have any credit history or if you are on the fence about whether you should rent to him or not.**

**LeaseRunner utilizes an “Instant Account Verification” process where LeaseRunner is authorized by the prospective renter to obtain read-only data from the renter’s bank account. The authorization form requires the applicant to enter his online banking credentials confirming the identity of the applicant with his bank. The bank account data is returned instantaneously and formatted into an easy-to-read cash flow report.**

Seeking drastic life change financial advice,"Dramatic and Drastic life change, tips, tricks, advice? 

So I am 9 months out of a traumatic break up after 8 years. I am in therapy and have been diagnosed with PTSD from the events of the break up that lasted about 5 months.

I am slowly recovering and spending this time alone, reading, working, and finding myself. I have come to decide that I really want or may even need to leave where I am in life and just f off for a while, travel, experience things. Caine in KungFu. 

I realize this is an emotionally charged decision and nothing has been set in stone.

I am in my early 30s

I have a masters and certification in my field (tech). Four years working experience in that field, and 7 years experience in a high paying trade. 

I currently make 100K/yr (metro western wa). With a state retirement program that is not yet vetted (3 more years). I’m a vet with 10% disability and receive monthly tax free income from that.

I bought a home in 2015 and it’s valued at 490-510K, I owe 280K, it needs some maintenance and repair, to reach that high end but it seems I am still in a sellers market. 

I have 30K in debt I over pay on. 10K in a Roth. 3K in a taxable investment account and 5K in savings. 

I have been seriously considering selling the house, traveling for 1-2 years and buying back into the housing market in home town in metro Ohio. 

I currently have a part time full remote contract position in addition to my full time role. I could probably talk my current position in letting me go half time and full remote from another country or state. 

I’ve never done anything like this before. 

My current plan is to just jump into a major lifestyle change, scrimp and save and do the home repairs, check in with my own and my dogs physical health, re-open my VA disability case and see if I can’t get higher rating. Possibly marketing the home myself and look for cash offers or investment buyers (the home is traditional but on the largest lot in a great area). Maybe someone would be interested in mortgage re-assignment with the 2.5% rate I currently have ? I wouldn’t know wtf I was doing with all of that. I contacted a few of those buy it as is with cash places, and got a pretty tempting offer from one, but decided to take a step back and make this a real plan and not a quick decision. 

My sister is having a baby in August and I’ve been the prodigal son for over a decade I figured after all this it would be nice to be back in my family’s lives and help out some, while also spending some time traveling. Getting another job or even a fully remote role would be easy peasy. I would probably look for something I could do the bare minimum at given my emotional place. I’ve tossed around the idea of starting my own business in my field. 

Anyway. I hate this house, this town, this state, more than a quarter of my life I shared with a person and I just can’t anymore. 

Any advice?

"Trying to help a family member in a dire situation - newly widowed with severe health issues, no income, and a small child ","Hi, I am not really sure where to start with the post but I am trying to help my family. My cousin, A, is 38F, and we live in NJ. She has been battling concerning and undiagnosed health issues, has a 6-year-old, and her husband just died a few days ago completely out of the blue. He was the sole provider for the family. Here are some basics:

* A’s been suffering from health issues for years that have escalated. She was in the hospital in December in NJ, and the doctors here have run out of ideas of what’s wrong. Tests are leaning toward some type of cancer or autoimmune disease. They have referred her to a teaching/research hospital in NYC. She has had one appointment there with a hematologist/oncologist. She has appointments with rheumatology and dermatology scheduled in late March/April. 
* Her husband had good health insurance which she will lose in 30 days (before her next appointments). 
* She has no income and honestly probably isn’t well enough to work at the moment. However, I am not sure if she can qualify for disability without a diagnosis. 
* Her husband did have some life insurance and I am not privy to all of their financial info but the gist of it is that she does not have very much money. She can probably get some family help financially; but no one in the family can afford to take on full expenses for an adult and a small child. 
* She should qualify for Medicaid income-wise, but we are not sure if she’ll be able to go out of state to continue care in NYC. Her daughter should also be eligible for Medicaid. 
* Her father may be able to help pay for COBRA for a period of time, but we are not sure what to expect in terms of price. 
* She does own her home in a low-income housing community.
* Her husband was a veteran. And even though he has life insurance, he had no will. 

The TDLR is she has no income, no real means to work, and soon she will be losing her insurance and she has a young child. I will try to answer more questions if I can to help clarify things. Thank you, internet strangers, for any advice you have about what she could do or what services might be available to her.

Unfair pension buyout from hospital?,"Reaching out on behalf of my mom who was recently told her hospital is buying out her pension and leaving her with way less for retirement than she expected.

Basic facts: She is 55. She has been a nurse for decades and has worked at the same hospital for 24 years under the pretense she would be receiving a pension of $1,300/month upon retirement at 65. She plans to work 10 more years.

The hospital where she has been a nurse for the last 24 years is saying they are going to buy out her pension for $93,000, and framing it as “an opportunity to control your own money.” But, by her math, they are ripping her off by nearly $200,000.

If she lived just 20 years post retirement, she would make nearly $312,000 off pension payments at the $1,300/month rate. But with $93,000, she is looking at monthly payments of nearly $1,000 less per month. Even if she invested the $93k for ten years, she believes she would be receiving significantly less than expected.

This seems like a non-negotiable thing from the hospital. Does she have any leverage in this situation to ask for a higher pay-out? And if not, how can she best work with the buyout of $93,000?",PersonalFinance,StrawberrySoyBoy,1708629219.0,22,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1axeun9/unfair_pension_buyout_from_hospital/
my moms in a lot of debt,"hi everyone, this is really weird b/c i’ve never posted on here before, but i’m at a loss and don’t know what to do.

i’m gonna try to be as detailed but vague as possible for personal reasons.

my mom is a lovely woman and i love her to death, but she’s not great with finances at all. we had a car together where i was unknowingly(to me) excluded on insurance, i got into a really bad weather induced accident and almost lost my life. thank god i’m alive but the car was completely totaled. insurance didn’t cover (obviously) and now we’re out a car with a 17,000 dollar bill still left on it.

my mom’s also in a lot of credit card debt, we’re behind on rent payments and the totaled car payments as well, her credit score is low and we need to move out soon due to our lease being up. she’s in a situation where she’s completely stuck and hopeless. she’s very depressed and im extremely worried about her.

i know a lot of her debt could’ve been avoided, and i understand financial literacy is important, but she was never taught proper financial literacy or independence and is really just winging it (for lack of a better word)

i currently work full time and make a good amount for my age, im also in college full time, i try to help as much as i can but im young and i don’t know much about finances, i was hoping someone could offer some advice on how i can help her or how i could possibly give her a good starting point to go up rather than down.

edit** my mom also works full time 6-6 as a lead position in the medical field (no college background so she really doesn’t make that much)

Figuring out if I should buy a house with my parents,"So I don't know if this is the right place for this, and if not I'd appreciate advice on where else to put it. But I have to move in a few months because the house I'm living in is being sold.

 Now my parents aren't doing well financially and want me to take out a loan for a house, they will pay most of the payment and I'll have a $500 payment. But I don't know if this the best idea, because I don't know if I want to stay where I am or move somewhere else, or if now we would get a bad deal.

 My parents say they'll refinance if I do want to move, but I know I wouldn't have first time home buyer benefits anymore, and my parents don't have a great track record with this kind of thing. I don't want to leave them high and dry but I don't know what I want or what is best for me.

Any advice would be appreciated and I will do my best to answer any questions to help you guys help me.

paid under the table and panicking,"I am 24 and have been a nanny for 2 years now and have been paid under the table through Zelle the entire time. Lately it’s been weighing on me that I’m eventually going to need to file my taxes and I’m panicking. I don’t want to commit tax fraud and I’m wondering if filing as self-employed would be tax fraud ? Sorry if this is stupid but I am way in over my head and kinda scared because I don’t know how taxes work very well. I moved to NYC two years ago and was incredibly desperate for work and agreed to be paid without a W2 because I didn’t even know I needed a W2 (Incredibly stupid- I know). I worked for 2 families- one family paid me 19k one year and then I quit, and the other has been paying me 20k for two years. I am wondering two things right now- how much should I expect to owe when I file this, and is there any way I can avoid asking the families to sign a W2 as both families have made veiled remarks about wanting to pay me under the table (Which I’m realizing is really shitty of them and I have been screwed over). 

Bonus things are 
1. someone told me once that if I was claimed as a dependent during these years by my parent I could avoid paying taxes but that sounds untrue or just flat out illegal. Any two cents on that would be helpful because it sounds like questionable advice  and I’m curious what the truth is

and 2. Someone on a nanny thread suggested nannies paid under the table should file as “misclassified” and I’m curious about that too

Should I invest MY savings?,"My fiance(29M) and I(26F) bought our home together a little over a year ago. It took every saved dollar we had to do it and do any needed repairs. Since then we have also paid off all personal debt(aside from my car which has about $7k left at 3.24%). Our 3-month emergency fund is in a shared HYSA and is just about fully funded. On top of that though, I've been putting away money into my personal savings and have close to $3k in there(separate personal HYSA). Should I be putting it into the stock market instead of HYSA since we have an emergency fund?

 I don't have anything I'm really saving towards short or long term, aside from retirement obviously. It's just there mostly for when I'd like to buy something bigger than my weekly fun budget or if one week I have an unexpected expense come up. 

A few side notes:

1. I'm in no rush to pay off my car. It's extremely manageable at $261/month. Car is a 2018 that is well maintained and runs well. 

2. I plan to make our emergency fund six-months, possibly up to a year of expenses eventually. The first goal for us was 3 months though. 

3. I know $3k is not much, but I don't have unexpected purchases over maybe $200-300. For example I went to the eye doctor today, that was $220 because my insurance doesn't cover the imaging they do to not have to dilate my pupils(and works better). I used my savings for that. It's also rare for me to use my savings, so I could see it eventually growing to 5-figures.

4. Please don't tell me how you shouldn't buy a 
house with someone you're not married to. It can't be undone, and even if it could I wouldn't change it.

Debt collector keeps contacting me for auto accident I was not at fault in (CA),"I was involved in an accident in October last year. I was driving my then girlfriend’s car and did not know she didn’t have insurance. We were backing out of a parking spot and someone else decided to back out after we started backing out directly  across from us reversing into the same direction causing a minor rear bumper collision. I gave the lady my number but was in a rush but I know I was not at fault for the accident. No cops were called to the scene. 

Flash forward to now I have gotten a few letters from a collection agency saying they will try to get my license suspended. They first contacted me December of last year I believe. First they tried intimidating me into paying $4700. Then they sent another letter trying to get me to pay $2600 this time. 

I’m not sure if this is a scam and don’t know what to do. I shouldn’t owe any money. The accident is 50/50 fault at most. And not my fault at all at best.

Advice on dental plan vs HSA out of pocket.,"I'm seeking some advice!!. Lost my job on early 2023 and to keep getting dental coverage got a dental plan that costs $227 per month and covers family and kids (wife+4kids). Got a new job and has a dental plan that is not as good and does not include our dentists as in network. Doing some math, if I was to cover all my dental expenses out of pocket from May 2023 to Feb 2024 they ammount to $4594. Plan has paid $2666 and I have paid $1926 plus $2270 in monthly plan costs.

My plan is to stop the dental plan payment and not renew, deposit a portion of this to HSA, lets say $200/mo and cover dental costs out of pocket to offset whatever the new work dental plan wont cover...

Car Insurance Reimbursement,"Hi all, hopefully this is the right spot for this. Looking for some help on how to proceed.

Last month, I got into a minor fender bender accident that I was not at fault in. The other driver wasn't insured. I called the police, filed a claim, provided photos, etc. My damage wasn't too bad, but the bumper was cracked and had a few holes that went through it. 

I have a $500 deductible, and my insurance company quoted the damage at 625 (basically for new paint). I called them up and they recommended an collision shop for me, I walked into the place and made an appointment, provided insurance and claim info.

A day later, the collision center canceled my appointment saying they don't work on total losses (they quoted $2200, KBB value is 7-8k). I called up my insurance and they said that's not right and rescheduled an appointment for me at the same place.

Took the car in, had it repaired, paid for it. I asked them if everything on the insurance side happens automatically and they said I'd need to contact Geico separately to have that taken care of. 

I submitted the bill and called my claims rep, who then asked if I was planning on going it through insurance, which I said obviously yes. Apparently it was never communicated to the shop that this was going through insurance, even though the Geico rep set up the appointment for me.

Geico reached out and offered an additional $800 toward the claim but said I'll have to negotiate with the body shop to cover the additional 1500 I already paid for.

Am I screwed by this miscommunication, or do I have some sort of recourse? Feels like I'm out of luck considering the shop already got their money

Tldr;
Geico made an appointment for me to get my car fixed, I got it fixed and paid for, now Geico is telling me that it was never submitted through insurance by the shop who claims that it was never labeled as an insurance claim.",PersonalFinance,dinodiscount,1708642098.0,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1axkafx/car_insurance_reimbursement/

"Home destroyed in landslide, insurance won't cover it. Seeking advice","Hi Reddit -

My home in the Northeast US was totaled by a natural disaster (small landslide caused by historic rain event) a few months ago. I'm hoping to connect with anyone who has been through something similar before or could offer me some guidance on how to deal with the bank, possible foreclosure, and stay financially above water so I can put this behind me and move on with my life. I have exhausted every resource and connection I have personally so I am turning to the internet. Here is some pertinent info:

\- Insurance has denied the claim, as ""earth movements"" were not covered by my homeowners policy. They have also notified me that they will be non-renewing my policy.                                         

  
\-I have had preliminary discussions with several local lawyers. They haven't seen an opportunity to fight the insurance decision as the circumstance surrounding the damage is a pretty clear cut exclusion from homeowners policies. 

\- I have an outstanding mortgage on the property (\~185k) that I'm still actively paying despite the home being uninhabitable. I do have PMI on the mortgage, if that's relevant at all.

\- The home cannot feasibly be rebuilt or moved. A structural engineer gave me an order of magnitude estimate of 2.5 million (Original purchase was only \~220k). This may seem confusing but half the land of my small narrow lot is now in a river.

\-  I have reached out to every imaginable state and federal agency (FEMA), department, relief organization, etc. So far nothing has come of this as I was basically the hardest hit house in the area, and my county did not meet the threshold for an official disaster declaration.

\- I have spoken to my mortgage company and let them know what happened. They have been horrible to deal with and I honestly wish I hadn't said anything.

\- A company left a sticker on my door last week saying that they are ""securing"" the property and changing the locks for the mortgage company. The mortgage company says they have no idea about this and did not tell anyone to do this. I, and others I have spoken to, feel they are beginning foreclosure proceedings behind my back.

What should I do in this situation? I considered simply walking away and allowing them to foreclose, but I live in a recourse state and I'm worried they could come after my retirement accounts. Is there any way they would negotiate on a buyout? The home and the land it once sat on are close to worthless at this point, so I was hoping they might take considerably less than the full amount I owe? How would I go about doing this successfully? Additionally, do I have any rights as a homeowner that prevent them from trying to foreclose on the property? I'm completely up to date on my mortgage, but I'm worried about the insurance cancelation coming into play.

Thank you for any advice you can offer. I have cross-posted this to a couple of subs to try to get in front of as many eyes as possible. I'll try to answer as many questions I can without giving away too much personal info - the mortgage company has already made comments via phone about my personal life and retirement assets that made me uncomfortable. I'd prefer not to post photos of the carnage unless mods would like me to for validity of my story.",PersonalFinance,Weiner_Schnozzle,1708526606.0,1026,191,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1awdp92/home_destroyed_in_landslide_insurance_wont_cover/

First Time Home Buyer in Today’s Market…. ARM?,"I know this topic comes up often. My wife and I are first time home buyers, we’ve moved around over the last 4-5 years as she finished up school and then a residency. Finally feel ready to buy a home, except both home prices and rates are much higher compared to 2019. 

The other consideration is we like where we are now, but feel like we might move in ~5 years either to a new city closer to family, or into a bigger house as kids (hopefully) enter the picture. 

I know the math on selling a house too soon, and general rule of thumb is to hold for 5 years and you likely come out okay (assuming the housing market holds up). My thought is given our lack of conviction we’d be here for the long term, we could do a 7/1 ARM to get a slightly lower rate. We could then pay additional towards principal (we are not going to stretch ourselves here on the house/payment we sign up for) and then the end scenarios are 1) we end up moving and we’re able to pay less interest than a 30 year fixed 2) rates are lower after 7 years when the price adjusts or 3) rates are higher but we can still afford the payments because we did not overextend, and if we love where we are and love the house we can continue to aggressively pay down the mortgage. And somewhere mixed in to scenarios 2 and 3 is the ability to refinance before Year 7, assuming housing values have held or gone up.

Can anyone poke holes in this strategy? Looking for genuine feedback, no pride in authorship here. Also I know some will say to rent, but we have lived in 3 different rental homes in the last 5 years and are really excited and ready to make a home our own.

Looking for an investment situation I'm not sure exists,"Hi knowledgeable people! Apologies in advance for the very ignorant block of text below:

I'm a freelancer in a large city with a high cost of living. After 20 years of mostly doing okay but always with at least a little debt and no savings, now, at 41, with a spouse and two kids, I've finally landed a game changer gig which has made about 650K/year (gross) in both 2022 and 2023. It's still going but could end at any time. I have some catching up to do.

After paying off my debt, starting a SEP, setting aside a modest emergency fund, 529s for my kids, and some additional for some upcoming house renovation costs, I've got about 30-50K I'd like to put into a general purpose investment account. I'd like to put more into it before this job dries up so that, when it inevitably does, I'll have a bit of padding (which would ideally be making some of its own money) until the next gig comes along (the additional mental and emotional space I have being debt free has given me resolve to never let it happen again). I'm trying for the first time in my life to think ahead about my money and try to take care of future-me and future-my-kids.

I've done a little research on a few places to start a brokerage account (Vanguard, where my SEP is, as well as Schwab and Fidelity), but I think I may be in a bit of an uncommon situation. I know very little about investing, and less about how investment accounts/advisors work, so I'd need some hand holding to get started, but I think I'd like to have a little more flexibility and control if I end up being able to put a real amount of money into it.

So, I'd love to have:

1. the option to just set-and-forget, so the account can just grow without my intervention. This is where a robo-investment account is appealing, since it's low risk stuff that I ideally wouldn't need to pay an advisor for;
2. But I'd also like the option to buy my own stocks/funds if and when I'm in a position financially and research-wise to start doing that;
3. And finally, would love to have the ability to ask a real person to look at my account and give me actual consultation, or trade stocks on my behalf, since as mentioned I don't know anything, and in the next 5 years I might be putting anywhere from zero to $250K additional funds in the account.

Ironically a lot of the descriptions of the accounts these firms offer seem to assume you're going to have the same amount of money in them forever. I may want an algorithm investing for me when I only have $300, but what about when I have $5 million? What's the plan, besides closing that crappy account?

I know that Schwab and Fidelity have good customer service, but that seems to be related more to the logistical operation of the account rather than actual investment recommendations. From what I can tell, in order to get personalized advice you need to be in wealth-management territory, which means 100-500K in your portfolio, minimum. If I'm able to keep contributing to my account for a while that could happen at some point, but I'm not sure I have the wherewithal to invest it properly in the meantime, and it's a little unclear whether I can change my account to accommodate that in the future.

So I guess my question is - do any of these firms offer an account with the option to get personalized investment advice for less than 100K? Is my best bet to open a cheap robo advisor account and then close it and open a new one if and when my needs change? Should I learn to invest it myself and get an advisor when and if I have 500K on hand? Or am I overthinking it and I should just put as much money as possible into index funds and call it a day?

BTW, I realize that for a lot of people, starting an account to insulate against losing your job is fundamentally an emergency fund, and not a place to be trading stocks or doing anything remotely risky. And I get that, but unemployment is a fundamental part of my profession and lifestyle, so that's why I'm thinking of this differently. Just wanted to clarify.

Retirement Contributions 37 years old,"Howdy, as i get older here i am researching more and more about retirement.  I work in corperate america and make a salary of 117k. Currently in my Portfolio I have 45k in a Roth Account and 57k in a Roll over IRA.  These are accounts that I have sitting from a previous employer.  In my current job I am doing a 5% to roth and 3% to a Traditional.  The company does the 3/2 match which equits to about 4% 100% match.  So with that being said, my 5% Roth basically is maxing me out for contributions each year but i am wondering if it would be better to switch some of these numbers around to save on taxes now.  I think i have a pretty good start overall, i see my salary over the next 5 years maybe getting to the 135k range.

Investing for my kids,"Hi!
Using an anonymous account for privacy reasons.

Our two daughters were child actors from ages 1-6. We never planned on them being actors and it was just a ""lucky"" accident. They're now completely normal kids and we have no intention of them further pursuing any acting (unless they want to when they're older).

Each of them has:
$125k in cash
$80k in a Coogan account (which I believe we can't touch or even invest)$
8.5k in the SAG pension plan (https://www.sagaftraplans.org/sag-pension)

Their dad and I are divorced. In the past, we couldn't agree on what to do with the money. I suggested investing it, but we couldn't get on the same page and just ended up putting it in CDs for the time being.

The CD just ran out and we're on much better terms now (co-parenting, yeah!).

We're now pondering what to do and friends pointed me to Reddit (here and r/investing) as I might get better advice than a financial advisor at the bank.

A bit more context:
- My ex-husband and I both invest our own money with Wealthfront with an automated portfolio. However, they don't have custodial accounts so we can't use it for the girls.

- My ex-husband also has a part of his invested money managed by a small multi-family office that charges 1.5% and invests in individual stocks. He likes it a lot and says their focus is on preserving wealth and making very safe ""value investor"" bets. A point of tension in the past.

- The girls are 7 now and we don't need to touch any of the money until they get it when they're 18. We're well off (earning high six figures, no debt, own paid-off property, have saved a lot) and can comfortably pay for anything the kids might need (including piano lessons, tutoring, camps, vacations, etc).

- I'm not American and still haven't wrapped my head around retirement accounts or the SAG pension plan. Maybe we should open a 401k for the kids or invest their SAG pension plan? Since kids rarely have independent income at this age, you can't find much online.

- I don't think we can do anything with the Coogan account (not even invest it). So this feels like it's already a healthy cash baseline and our reasoning is we can basically invest 95% of the rest of the money.

I pay $250/mo total towards my credit card debt and nothing at this time to student loans.

$20000 - Buy car outright or finance ???,"I have about $20,000 to spend on a vehicle. It needs to be a crossover SUV, so I’m pretty set on the Toyota Highlander as I’ve read and researched many great things about this car.

There are a few factors that are involved:

1. I will not have any verification of income outside of my contract with my job for after graduation.
2. I have a very little credit history, so my score is pretty low.
3. I’m hoping to keep car insurance & a car payment pretty low, not really willing to spend more than $350 in total between these 2.

"Parents bought whole life policy as a baby, cashed out, can I get the info from insurance company?","Like the title, parents purchased a whole life policy when I was born. Sometime around 10 years ago (give or take), they informed me they would no longer be paying it, and wanted to cash it out, so the insurance company they had it through (Thrivent), would be sending paperwork and they wanted the cash from the check. This was the first I even knew of this policy.

My memory is fuzzy from then, but I do know the check came in my name. I signed it over to them.

Now, I am in need of the date the policy was cancelled. Parents have no idea and won't call Thrivent, even though they still use their services/have an account.

Would it be possible for me to call Thrivent and get any type of info? All I can really provide them is my name, SS#, and the address that I lived at the time.

Buying a Second/Vacation Home?,"Hi! I posted this on another sub, but looking for advice as this is something totally new to me. Apologies for the length, but I am looking for all the advice that I can get!I am looking to potentially buy a vacation home (condo) in a ski resort area (not quite Jackson or Park City, but close) that's also centrally located to two major national parks. While not quite a major destination, it seems like the area is definitely on its way there and adjacent to other more established vacation destinations. The reason that I am looking at this location is due to its adjacency and the fact that I fell in love with this area after visiting the national parks (and also calculating the costs for repeat visits).

The place that I am looking at is $395K with an HOA of $325/month. Due to how high rates are currently, I would definitely be looking to refinance once there's a drop. My primary residence is on the East coast so the travel would be a factor--the plan would be to go and stay for weeks (months?) at a time and potentially do STR for the majority of the time that we weren't there to offset costs. I am definitely not looking at this as an investment property in the short term, although I think there's potential for appreciation. I earn $180-210K/year with my portion of our mortgage/taxes being \~$1600/month (2.75% 30 yr. fixed rate, 27 years left) and my only other debt is a \~$600 car payment that I have 11 months left on and I am able to put 20-25% down. 

My basic question is would this be a terrible idea? I don't want to be in a position where I feel like I'm squeezing by every month and tanking my existing quality of life. I also don't want to be locked in to a position where I feel like I'm obligated to only visit this property for every vacation.

Question about removing ex from mortgage,"Hi everyone. I'll do my best to be brief. 

Two years ago, my partner and I bought a home together. At the time, we had been together nearly 9 years and although we hadn't yet, we'd planned to get married. Well, fast forward to today and we never did get married and are now dissolving our relationship indefinitely. She is moving into an apartment and I am staying in the house. Given the timing of our purchase, we were fortunate to lock in a rate of 2.9% on our mortgage, which is a large part of why I am able to afford the home on only my income going forward. Regardless, she would like to be taken off the mortgage. 

I spoke with a friend who is a realtor and was told we could pursue a Quit Claim Deed which would, in effect, remove my partner from the deed and then the lender would remove her from the mortgage. Some light googling seemed to back this up. We contacted our title company and had this form drawn up, but when my ex went in to sign it, she asked the person at the title company for confirmation that this would take her off the mortgage. The title company employee told her that was not the case and, in order for her to be removed from the mortgage, we would need to refinance. 

If anyone has any information about this or is familiar with this process, any advice is appreciated. With interest rates as they are currently, refinancing is not an option that allows me to keep the home, so we are uncertain of how to proceed. 

If it matters, we are in Minnesota.",PersonalFinance,pedropascalswager,1708633682.0,3,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1axgrox/question_about_removing_ex_from_mortgage/

Expat locked out of bank account,"So I’m an American living and working in Vietnam. I will move to China in august where I will be making more money, but the first 6 weeks I will need to support myself. 

I currently have a few thousand less than the 5-6 thousand USD I will need during that time. 

But I’m locked out of my American bank account. There’s only about $900 in there, less than the cost to fly home. I’d really like to regain access to it, as well as set up some REIT accounts and bonds. I just want safe investments where I can put my money in and forget I have it, it’s much easier to save money if it’s not all just in my checking account.

I estimate it will cost about $ 1500 for the round trip flight and $1000 for a 10 day trip. I have access to free housing with my family but not free rides or free food. 

Would it be better to wait until December to do this? I worry the jet lag would effect my new job in China 
Should I do this trip this summer and come to China slightly under budget? Apparently you can rough it a bit there, but I worry that it may be too overwhelming.

Leasing a car sounds like a deal to me…,"Hi!

I’m planning to buying a new Mercedes Benz 2024 c class sedan this weekend that costs roughly 50k. After selling my old car, I have collected 30k for a down payment. I’m in the market to find a good auto loan rate and the lowest I can get is 5.24-5.89% for 36 months. My Chase bank gave me 7.24% for 36 months.

I called my dealer and he said that if I do a lease with Mercedes Benz then I can get 4.78% for 36 months. He also mentioned that I can pay less on tax because I wouldn’t have to pay 12% upfront. He mentioned that since my tax will be divided up each month, in the end, I will be paying less in tax overall. He also mentioned that this will save me more since I’ll have the option to purchase the car when the lease is up (which is nice since I was going to purchase the car anyway).

I’ve been reading online that lease is the worst way to purchase a car. But in my case, it doesn’t seem that bad.

In short, we’re hoping there’s a type of finance person we could hire to help us with this as a mediator or an arbiter of some kind, but we’re not sure if that’s a lawyer, a financial adviser or something else. Is there a particular position, speciality or field that we should be looking for? 


ETA / TLDR: I think we’re most concerned with where she should draw the money from and need help navigating that. Eg:

Should she take it from our eventual trust that we’ll get after mom passes? And when that happens she’s immediately paid back?

Should she just draw it from her own checking and we do some sort of contract?

We figure there’s a best way to skin this cat and we want to choose the one that puts are personal relationship at the least risk.",PersonalFinance,finance_help-pls,1708652198.0,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1axo6hw/looking_for_a_mediator_or_adviser_to_help/
"18 year old turning 19 in a few months, questions about college","Hi I am a 18 year old sushi chef and currently making 60k/year and I wanted some insights on whether a college path would be worth while.

Down-payment on house or investing?,"Hi all,  
What would you do if you had enough money to buy a house. Would you pay for it cash, and forego the opportunity to invest?

Or just put a strong down payment (>20%) and get a loan and continue investing.  If so, how much would you keep investing vs down payment? Given the current interest rates of abut 6.5%. 

To put it in perspective a 2M house, with a 20% down payment would need a 1.6M loan. Which would incur and interest of about 8k a month.  ",PersonalFinance,monkeymite,1708637663.0,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1axig2f/downpayment_on_house_or_investing/

Advice with gym debt,"I had a 50$ a month gym membership. It was there month to month cancel anytime. One month, I missed the bill and when I went to work out I was locked out. Well I naively thought that it would cancel and went on for 6ish months and checked it, and realized I was still being charged 50$ a month. I made a mental note that I needed to cancel it and that I was frustrated. Fast forward 3 more months, I’ve forgotten about it. Just by chance reminded by some random comment on Reddit. I check, now I owe over 500$ to this gym for the last 9 months. My key has not worked so even though I have been getting charged, I did not have access. I finally cancelled this time, I realize my mistake and that it’s mostly my fault. Is there anything I can do about this? It just seems wrong that I accumulate 50$ a month in debt on something I had no access to and have not been paying.",PersonalFinance,Expert_Celery_2077,1708650748.0,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1axnob2/advice_with_gym_debt/
