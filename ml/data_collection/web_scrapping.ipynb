      "When you use Virtual Visa Debit to make a payment: a) The merchant performs an authorization on your personal deposit account at the time of the purchase and this authorization amount is immediately debited from that account. This process is followed by a settlement, typically 2-5 business days after authorization, which finalizes the amount of the purchase and, in some cases, reflects adjustments to the initial authorization amount. When this happens, a credit adjustment in the amount of the original authorization will be credited to your account, followed immediately by a debit adjustment that reflects the final settlement amount of your purchase. b) The funds are debited from your personal deposit account, which is the account you access with your RBC Royal Bank Client Card when you select the “Chequing” option on a point-of-sale terminal or at an ATM.

      "If you choose to opt out of your Complimentary Uber One Membership prior to the end of your Complimentary Membership Benefit Window by turning off the auto-renew functionality in the Uber App or Uber Eats App or if you cancel or remove your Eligible Card from your Uber account, your Complimentary Uber One Membership will be canceled at the end of the current month of your Complimentary Membership Benefit Window.\n",
      "If you transfer to another Eligible Card, your Complimentary Uber One Membership subscription offer may change. If you transfer to another Eligible Card or your Eligible Card expires or is replaced, or your card details change during your Complimentary Membership Benefit Window, you may need to remove your previous payment card and add your new Eligible Card details to continue enrollment in the Complimentary Uber One Membership.
